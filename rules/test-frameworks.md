# Test frameworks — detect, then use the right one

A test proves something only when it runs in the project's real framework and runner.
Don't hand-roll what `gtest`, `pytest`, or `vitest` already do. Build and verify WITH
the framework — "passing" means its runner reports pass.

## Discipline

- **Detect first.** Run `.opencode/tools/facts.sh` (it reports the detected framework)
  or read the manifest. Match the framework AND the existing test style.
- **One framework per language per repo.** If one is configured, use it. A second one
  fragments the suite — don't add it.
- **Don't reinvent.** Never hand-roll an assertion, mock, or runner the framework ships.
  Use its fixtures, matchers, and parameterization.
- **None yet?** Pick the canonical default for the stack (first column below) — the
  lowest-friction standard one — and say why in one line.
- **It must run in CI** via the project's test command (`facts.sh`), not only locally.

## Reference (canonical default first)

| **TS / JS** | Vitest (new projects) / Jest (existing); `node:test` zero-dep | fast-check                     | `vi.mock`/`jest.mock`, msw                | Playwright (preferred) / Cypress | Vitest bench, tinybench     |

## Pair with the matching agent

- `agents/builder.md` writes tests in the detected framework as the RED step of TDD.
- The `write-test` skill generates coverage in that framework, in its idiom.
- Property-based tests count toward "done" (`quality-bar.md`) for anything that parses
  external input — generate inputs, don't only hand-pick examples.
